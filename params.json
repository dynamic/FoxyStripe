FoxyStripe provides a product catalog that integrates with the FoxyCart shopping cart and API.\r\n\r\nFeatures include:\r\n\r\n*\tAdd to Cart Form\r\n*\tProduct Options\r\n*\tOrder History\r\n*\tSingle Sign On\r\n*\tHMAC Product Verification\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n\r\n*  SilverStripe 3.1.x\r\n\r\n#### Composer Installation\r\n\r\n`\"require\": { \"dynamic/foxystripe\": \"dev-master }`\r\n\r\nAdd `foxystripe` to your `.gitignore` file.\r\n\r\n#### Git Installation\r\n\r\n`git clone git@github.com:dynamic/FoxyStripe.git foxystripe`\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Add-Ons\r\n\r\nThe following add-ons are optional, but will enhance FoxyStripe when installed:\r\n\r\n*\t[GridField Better Buttons](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/unclecheese/betterbuttons)\r\n*\t[GridField Bulk Editing Tools](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/colymba/gridfield-bulk-editing-tools)\r\n*\t[Quick Add New](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/sheadawson/quickaddnew)\r\n*\t[Sortable GridField](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/undefinedoffset/sortablegridfield)\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nOnce FoxyStripe is installed, run a dev/build to setup the database.\r\n\r\n#### FoxyCart Setup\r\n\r\nLogin to your [FoxyCart Account](https://admin.foxycart.com/admin.php) and create a new store. See [Creating a FoxyCart Account](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/1.1/getting_started/foxycart_setup) for detailed instructions.\r\n\t\r\nOnce you've completed the initial FoxyCart setup, your store is ready to work with FoxyStripe. You'll want to revisit the FoxyCart admin to setup Shipping, Taxes, and additional Product Categories.\r\n\r\n#### FoxyStripe Setup\r\n\r\nNow that your store has been created, you'll need to grab some information from FoxyCart to configure your FoxyStripe site.\r\n\r\nIn CMS > Settings > FoxyStripe\r\n\t\r\n1. Store Name - enter value from FoxyCart > Store > Settings > Store sub domain - ex: `myfoxystripestore`\r\n2. Store Key - enter value from FoxyCart > Store > Advanced  > API key - ex: `xxxxxxxxxxxxx1234`\r\n\r\nYour FoxyStripe store is now setup and ready for business. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Product Groups\r\n\r\nProduct Groups are Pages in the CMS that display a list of related products. By default, Product Groups will show its child Product Pages.\r\n\r\nA Product can also be added to multiple Product Groups via the Products tab on a Product Group Page. To enable this feature, go to Settings > FoxyStripe and check `Multi-Group Support`.\r\n\r\n#### Products\r\n\r\nProducts are managed as Pages in the CMS. To add a Product to a Product Group, create a new Product Page under a Product Group page in the Site Tree.\r\n\r\nOnce your Product Page is saved, it will include an Add to Cart form, allowing customers to add it to the FoxyCart shopping cart for purchase.\r\n\r\nNote - all products are required to have a unique Product Code. FoxyCart will use this as a unique identifier in transactions.\r\n\r\n##### Product Options\r\n\r\nProduct Options allow you to set modifiers to your products. Examples include:\r\n\r\n*\tSize - Small, Medium, Large\r\n*\tColor - Red, Blue, Green\r\n\r\nBy using the fields in the 'Modifiers' tab, you can change certain Product values if that option is selected. These include:\r\n\r\n*\tWeight - +/- shipping costs\r\n*\tPrice - a hardcover book costs more than a paperback\r\n*\tProduct Code - add a style number to your product code\r\n\r\nThese values and modifications will be passed to FoxyCart, and will be displayed on the order receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### FoxyCart Product Categories\r\n\r\nEach Product asks you to assign a FoxyCart Product Category.\r\n\r\nFoxyCart categories offer a way to give products additional behaviors that cannot be accomplished by product options alone. You can assign properties for groups of products, such as Taxes, Shipping and Coupon Codes.\r\n\r\nProduct Categories are created in your FoxyCart account under Products > Categories. You must also manually create this category in your FoxyStripe store.\r\n\r\nIn CMS > Products > FoxyCart Category:\r\n\r\n1. Click `Add FoxyCart Category`\r\n2. FoxyCart Category Description - enter value from FoxyCart > Category > Description\r\n3. FoxyCart Category Code - enter value from FoxyCart > Category > Category code\r\n4. Click `Create`\r\n\r\nSee [Product Categories](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/1.1/categories) for more information on setting up categories in FoxyCart.\r\n\r\n#### Security\r\n\r\nWhile SSL is not required to use FoxyStripe, it is recommended that you run your production instance of FoxyStripe as SSL. This will prevent any 'insecure connection' warnings you may receive during the checkout process.\r\n\r\nIn `mysite/config_php`, add the following to force the site into SSL in live mode:\r\n\r\n`if(Director::isLive()) {\r\n\tDirector::forceSSL();\r\n}`\r\n\r\n### Additional Features\r\n\r\n#### FoxyCart DataFeed\r\n\r\nNext we will setup your store's DataFeed, which allows FoxyCart to push transaction and user information to your FoxyStripe site. This is required for the more advanced features listed below, such as Single Sign On and Order History\r\n\r\nIn CMS > Settings > FoxyStripe\r\n\r\n1. Copy `FoxyCart DataFeed URL` to your clipboard - `https://myfoxystripestore.com/foxycart`\r\n\r\nIn FoxyCart > Store > Advanced:\r\n\r\n1. click 'would you like to enable your store's datafeed?' to enable the DataFeed\r\n2. Datafeed URL -  paste value from FoxyStripe\r\n\r\nYour FoxyCart store will now be able to communicate with your FoxyStripe site.\r\n\r\n#### Single Sign On\r\n\r\nEnabling single sign on will sync user account information between your SilverStripe site and FoxyCart. If the user is logged into your SilverStripe site prior to checkout, they will be auto logged in to FoxyCart.\r\n\r\nYou can enable this feature by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. In CMS > Settings > FoxyStripe:\r\n\t*\tCheck 'Enable Single Sign On'\r\n\t*\tCopy `Single Sign On URL` to your clipboard - `https://myfoxystripestore.com/foxycart/sso`\r\n2. In FoxyCart > Store > Advanced:\r\n\t* \tCheck `enable single sign on`\r\n\t*\tSingle sign on url - paste the value from FoxyStripe\r\n\t*\tCustomer password hash type - select `SHA-1, salted (suffix)`\r\n\t*\tCustomer password has config - enter `40`\r\n\t\r\nThis will setup a two way sync of user information between FoxyCart and FoxyStripe. If a user is created or modified in FoxyStripe, it will push that info via FoxyCart's API. If the user is created or modified during a FoxyCart transaction, FoxyStripe will receive the info via FoxyCart's DataFeed.\r\n\r\n[Member Profiles](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/ajshort/silverstripe-memberprofiles) is recommended for user login/registration, but any member management system should work with FoxyStripe.\r\n\r\n#### Order History\r\n\r\nIf you have Single Sign On enabled, and have setup a user login/registration system, you can allow your customers to view their order history in your FoxyStripe site.\r\n\r\nSimply create an Order History page in the appropriate area of your Site Tree. Once logged in, Customers will be able to review their order history, and access receipt from FoxyCart.\r\n\r\n#### HMAC Product Validation\r\n\r\nHMAC Product Validation will encrypt the add to cart forms on Product Pages. This prevents a user from manipulating the form prior to adding to cart. \r\n\r\nTo enable HMAC Product Validation in FoxyStripe:\r\n\r\n1. In FoxyCart > Store > Advanced:\r\n\t*\tCheck `would you like to enable cart validation?'\r\n2. In CMS > Settings > FoxyStripe:\r\n\t*\tCheck 'enable cart validation'\r\n\r\n### Maintainer Contact\r\n\r\n *  [Dynamic](http://www.dynamicdoes.com) (<info@dynamicdoes.com>)\r\n \r\n### FoxyCart Documentation\r\n\r\n[FoxyCart 2.0 API Docs](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/2.0/start)\r\n \r\n[FoxyCart 1.1 API Docs](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/1.1/start)\r\n \r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nInspired by previous work done by [cbryer](https://github.com/cbryer).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (c) 2014, Dynamic Inc\r\n\tAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\n\tRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n\tRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n\t\r\n\tRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n\t\r\n\tTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
